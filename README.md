# Project Happy Thoughts API

A backend for the frontend project happy thoughts. It's validating the data and saves the user input to the database using POST and PATCH requests. 

## The problem

Everything went smoothly, I used the lives sessions to answer the questions I had and that was enough. I'll see if i can add the pagination and infinite scroll before the deadline is up.
